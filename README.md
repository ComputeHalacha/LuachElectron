LuachElectron is a desktop version of the popular [Luach mobile application](https://github.com/ComputeHalacha/Luach) to keep track of a Jewish womens Halachic calendar.

The client side of the application uses React and Bootstrap.

It calculates all the days that require Halachic restrictions including calculations for Vesset Kavuah.

Besides for the _Niddah_ calendar functionality, Luach also shows the _Zmanim_ for anywhere in the world and has an Event/Occasion calendar as well.

The data is stored either locally on the running device in an SQLite database, or remotely on Compute servers.
